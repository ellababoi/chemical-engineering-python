    "a specified number of classes and determine the fraction of classes that\n",

    "The program should have the following attributes:\n",
    "a) The user can set a variable “NumTrials” equal to the number of virtual\n",
    "classes they wish to simulate. I initially set this variable to 1000.\n",
    "b) The user can set a variable “ClassSize” equal to the size of the class\n",
    "(e.g., 40, 60, 80, and 200).\n",
    "c) You should write a function that receives as input a numpy vector of\n",
    "length ClassSize that contains the birthday for every member of the\n",
    "class. The function should then determine if any two students have the\n",
    "same birthday (and return 1 or True in this case) or not (and return 0\n",
    "or False in this case).\n",
    "d) The program should run multiple trials. For each trial, you should\n",
    "construct a numpy vector of length ClassSize containing randomly\n",
    "assigned birthdays. I recommend using a number between 0\n",
    "and 364 to represent the birthday, and I recommend using the\n",
